## Upcoming Features
- **Messaging UI**: Well designed messaging interface that allows for storing, searching, and sharing conversations.   

- **Administation**:
  - Efficiently assign roles to employees in order to control which documents and data Cait will have access to while they are messaging. 
  - Allow administrators to test and observe Cait's messaging behavior.
  - Allow employees to request access to certain roles, documents, or data.      

       
- **Knowledge Base Connectors**: Easily connect Cait to documents in Google Drive, Confluence, Notion, Document360, or others.   

- **Chatbot Integrations**: Message with Cait like any other person in Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, or Google Chat. 

- **Understanding Diagrams and Images**: We plan for Cait to be able to understand diagrams and images so that she can include them in her responses.    

- **Open Source Models**: The ability to have any open source large language model and embedding model as parts of Cait's core brain.
